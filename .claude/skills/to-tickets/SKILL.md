  Slice an OpenSpec change into tracer-bullet tasks the factory can build one per
  run, quiz the owner on the breakdown, then write them into the change's
  tasks.md and publish them as GitHub sub-issues of the change's tracking issue
  with native blocking links. Use when the user says "/to-tickets <change-id>",
  "break this change into tickets", "slice the tasks", or has just written a
  proposal that the factory should build. Do NOT use for a change that fits one
  run (write a one-task tasks.md instead), or for work outside OpenSpec.

# To tickets

Turn an OpenSpec change into **tasks**: tracer-bullet vertical slices, each
declaring the tasks that **block** it. `tasks.md` stays the source of truth: the
factory router, `(owner)` escalation, per-change ticking and `no_go` all read
it. The GitHub issues are a published copy that shows the plan and its blocking
edges, and each one closes when the PR that lands its task merges.

## 1. Read the change

Read `openspec/changes/<id>/proposal.md` (including its `## Autonomy` block),
`design.md` if present, every `specs/*/spec.md` delta, and any existing
`tasks.md`. Read the code the change touches, using the repository's own names.
Look for prefactoring: "make the change easy, then make the easy change".

## 2. Draft vertical slices

- Each task cuts a narrow but **complete** path through every layer it needs
  (schema, Worker route, UI, tests), not one layer of the change.
- Each task is **demoable** on its own: name what you can show when it lands.
  A task with no demo is a horizontal slice; rework it.
- Each task fits **one factory run**: one fresh context window that has never
  seen this conversation, about 30 to 60 minutes of work, inside the Claude
  job's timeout. Prefactoring goes first.
- A task that needs a `no_go` path (`node scripts/check-no-go.js --change <id>`
  lists them), a vendor console or production access is an `(owner)` task, or
  the change is not for the factory at all.
- **Wide refactors** (one mechanical change whose blast radius spans the
  codebase) use expand-migrate-contract instead: expand (new form beside the
  old), migrate in batches sized by blast radius, each blocked by the expand,
  then contract, blocked by every batch.

Give each task its blocking edges: the tasks that must land before it can start.
Number tasks so that **file order is a valid build order**, blockers first: the
router always takes the first unchecked task in `tasks.md`, top to bottom.

## 3. Quiz the owner

Show the breakdown as a numbered list. For each task: title, **Demo**,
**Blocked by**, and `(owner)` if it applies. Ask:

- Is the granularity right (too coarse, too fine)? Should any task merge or split?
- Is each blocking edge real?
- Does every task have a demo?

Iterate until the owner approves. **Write nothing and create no issue before
the approval.**

## 4. Write tasks.md

Rewrite `openspec/changes/<id>/tasks.md` in the repository's format:

```markdown
## 1. <group>

- [ ] 1.1 <title>: <what it delivers, end to end>.
      Demo: <what you can show when it lands>.
      Acceptance: <the tests that prove it>.
- [ ] 1.2 (owner) <title> ...
      Blocked by: 1.1.
```

Keep file paths and code out of task text, except where a prototype pinned a
decision (a schema, a state machine) more exactly than prose can.

## 5. Publish the tickets

1. Tracking issue: `n=$(node scripts/factory-issue.js <id>)` (it finds, adopts
   or creates the one labelled `factory:<id>`).
2. For each task in file order (blockers first, so their numbers exist):

   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "<id> <task number>: <title>" --body-file <file> \
     --parent "$n" [--blocked-by <issue>,<issue>]
   ```

   Body: `## What to build` (end-to-end behaviour), `## Demo`, `## Acceptance
criteria` as a checklist, and the line `Task <number> of OpenSpec change
<id>; tasks.md is the source of truth.` The blocking edges are native, so
   the body has no `Blocked by` section.

   **Never label a ticket `factory:<id>`.** That label marks the tracking
   issue; `scripts/factory-issue.js` and the router take the first open issue
   carrying it.

3. Append each ticket's number to its task line as soon as the issue exists,
   before creating the next one: `- [ ] 1.2 <title> (#812): ...`. `run-spec`
   writes `Closes #812` into the PR that lands the task.

If a run stops partway, re-run this step: skip every task whose line already
carries `(#<n>)`, and pass those numbers to `--blocked-by` for the tasks still
to publish. Never create a second issue for a task.

Do not close or edit the tracking issue.

## 6. Hand the plan to the owner

Commit the change folder on a `feature/*` branch
(`docs(openspec): tickets for <id>`) and push. Make sure the label exists
(`gh label create factory-ready --color 0e8a16 --description "Owner approved: the factory may start this change" --force`;
`factory-issue.js` already made `factory:<id>`), then open the PR labelled
`factory:<id>` and `factory-ready` and run `babysit-pr`. The owner merging it
is the approval that starts the build: the factory picks up the first task once
the plan is on `main`. Report the PR, the tracking issue and the ticket numbers.
